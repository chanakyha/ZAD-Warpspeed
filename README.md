A Luggage sharing service to save time and cost.

Aim: Make Flight Travel cheaper and more convenient.

Problem Statement: Flights charge exorbitant additional amounts when you exceed their free luggage capacity ( Ranging from 15-20 Kg ). This forces many to either send their luggage through different means or change their mode of travel.

Solution: To solve the above-mentioned problem, we are introducing ZAD. ZAD is a Dapp where you can connect with another traveler from your same flight on the same date and time ( who has free luggage capacity ). You can share your extra luggage with them for a lot cheaper rate than what the airport charges and in return he/she earns a few extra bucks for just carrying your luggage.

What if, The luggage got shared has illegal items ( like Bombs, Drugs, etc., ) / The person with whom you shared your luggage goes away with your luggage?

All users of our DAPP, have their E-KYC verified while they register to our DAPP ( This makes all our users more credible ). To avoid theft of luggage, NFT which is having greater value than the luggage will be shared with the wallet of the owner of the luggage.
Business Model: Zad Dapp follows the C2C ( Customer to Customer ) Business Model. We will earn our revenue from the transaction between the customers.
