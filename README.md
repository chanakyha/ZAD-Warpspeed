## ZAD Dapp 
A Luggage sharing service to save time and cost.

Aim : Make Flight Travels more cheap and convinient.

Problem Statement : Flights charge exorbitant additional amount when you exceed their free luggage capacity ( Ranging from 15-20 Kg ). This forces many to either send their luggage throught different means or change their mode of travelling.

Solution : To solve the above mentioned Problem , we are introducing ZAD. ZAD is a Dapp where you can get connected with another traveller from your same flight on same date and time ( who is having free luggage capacity ). You can share your extra luggage to him/her for a lot cheaper rate from what airport charges and in return he/she earns few extra bucks for just carrying your luggage.

    What if , The luggage got shared has illegal items ( like Bomb , Drugs ,etc., ) / The person with whom you shared your luggage goes away with your luggage ?
    
    All users of our DAPP , have their E-KYC verified while they register to our DAPP ( This makes all our users more credible ) . To avoid theft of luggage , an NFT which is having greater value than the luggage , will be shared to the wallet of owner of the luggage.

Business Model : Zad Dapp follows C2C ( Customer to Customer ) Business Model . We will earn our revenue from the transaction between the customers.
